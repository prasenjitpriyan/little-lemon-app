# ScrollView ðŸ‘‹

This material focuses on building a scrollable list in React Native using the ScrollView component, which is essential for displaying content that exceeds the mobile screen size.

1. Understanding ScrollView: The ScrollView component allows users to scroll up and down to view all menu items in the Little Lemon app, accommodating the limited screen space of mobile devices.
   It must be bounded by a height, which can be achieved by setting a height on the parent View component or using the flex property.

2. Implementing ScrollView in React Native: To create a scrollable menu, you need to import the ScrollView component and wrap it inside a View component with a defined height or flex 1. The ScrollView can contain Text components that display the menu items, and you can customize its appearance using props like style for padding and background color.
   Enhancing User Experience

The ScrollView component comes with an inbuilt touch responder system, allowing users to scroll smoothly on both iOS and Android devices.
There are many customization options available for the ScrollView, enabling you to tailor it to your app's specific needs.
